Beholder is a hot reloading support tool for programs using [Tizen.NET](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/)'s [NUI](https://docs.tizen.org/application/dotnet/guides/nui/overview/).

**Hot reloading** refreshes the files that were changed without losing the state of the app.

After launching the application on the emulator or real device, you can apply the changed file without stopping the application.
